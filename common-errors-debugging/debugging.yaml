# When running our debugging.py script it outputs wrongly indented env and choices will output error stating problem on line 7, column 4:
# while parsing a block mapping
#  in "debugging.yaml", line 2, column 3
# expected <block end>, but found '<block mapping start>'
#  in "debugging.yaml", line 7, column 4
# 
# It is having a block mapping start where it expected the block ends. Align the indentation with column two to fix it.

# Otherwise, with good indentations, when we run our debugging.py script it will output:
# [['nothing -']] (aka still a problem)

# on line 9 we are actually saying that we are having a list, and first list entry on list of lists
# so it's not seeing this as a literal dash, but as and indication of a list
# to fix this we put quotes over - nothing - not to create an accidental list entry
# Running python script again it will output ['- nothing -'] so it's no longer a list item in the list but just a list with one item
