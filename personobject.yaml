# In exercise.yaml, add information for a person object. This person object consists of the following, all at the top level:
# A name key
# An age key
# A list called hobbies that contains at least two hobbies

name: Dino
age: 29
hobbies:
- tennis
- cooking
- street workout

# `all at the top levelÂ´ means that the keys and values should be directly under the root level of YAML
# document and should not be nested within any other data structures like dictionaries or lists

# In our exercise means that keys name, age and hobbies should not be indented or nested within any other
# structure (should be first-level elements of YAML document)
