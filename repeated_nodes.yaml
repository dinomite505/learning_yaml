# Line 2. Here we see a key named 'new_key' containing 'repeated' node indicated with asterisk (*) in front of it

# This person contains a few mappings and an anchor name 'person'
# This way we can have a full node (name, age, address) and everything else in it as a repeated node.
# Mind if you're indenting out again (at the key 'another_person') our node ended,
# meaning as long as we're not on the level of name, age or address anymore our node is done.
# In key another_person on line 18 we are using our repeated node by specifying 'person' name with asterisk * in front
